yes javascript does have classes.This feature was introduced with the ECMAScript 2015 specifications(often referred to as ES6).However,its important to note that Javascript is primarily a prototype-based language and its classes are primarily syntactic sugar over existing prototype-based inheritance mechanisms. In other words,it provides a more familiar syntax for developers coming from class-based languages such as JAva or c++ but under the hood it works somewhat differently

## OOP(programming paradym)


## Object
- collection of properties(variables,constants) and methods(functions)
- toLowerCase , Date , promises etc.

--messup code


## parts components of OOP

Polymorphism(poly-multiple, morphism- ruuup)
